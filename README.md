# TAMLEP - TA ML Engineering Program - DS

Welcome to my **TAMLEP** (TA ML Engineering Program - Data Science) training repository! This repo contains all the tasks, assignments, and projects I have worked on as part of the training program. TAMLEP is a comprehensive program that covers various aspects of machine learning engineering, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## About TAMLEP

The **TA ML Engineering Program (TAMLEP)** is designed to provide hands-on training in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. It includes a series of modules that cover core concepts, practical implementations, and best practices in the field of machine learning engineering.

This repository serves as a portfolio of my learning and development throughout the program. It contains solutions, code implementations, and explanations for the various tasks completed in each module.

## Repo Structure

The repository is organized into **five modules** to reflect the structure of the TAMLEP training program. Each module folder contains the necessary code, exercises, and projects specific to that module.


### Module Breakdown:

1. **Module 1: Developer Environment**
   - This module covers the foundational concepts of data science and machine learning. I will learn about Git, Miniconda Installation and how to setup developer's enviornment on VS Code.

2. **Module 2: Coding Best Practices**
   - In this module, I deep dive into the preprocessing techniques that are best practices for good coding skills.

3. **Module 3: ML & DS Best Practices**
   - References on best practices on working with the usual python libraries that I use on a regular basis. Like creating the pipeline, function, class etc.
   - Hands-on tutorial ML Flow and exercise applying it to the housing price prediction problem

4. **Module 4: Build & Deployment**
   - Explore approaches to package and distribute your python code with other.
   - Learn how to use Docker and how to use it for packaging more complex dependencies.

5. **Module 5: Capstone using Code Templates**
   - Code Templates for Regression- Pre Read Material.
   - This is just a summary of all the learning.

## How to Use This Repository

- Each module folder contains the code and Jupyter notebooks for the tasks and projects I have worked on.
- The notebooks are organized by task within each module folder.
- You can explore the code and notebooks for solutions to common machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for all tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive development and data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and pipelines.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Docker**: For  building, shiping, and runing applications in containers.
