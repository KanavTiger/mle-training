### 3. **Create the `env.yml` File**
The `env.yml` file will define the dependencies needed to run your project. It should include both Python dependencies and any additional system dependencies that your package requires.

Hereâ€™s an example `env.yml` file:

```yaml
name: myenv
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - pip
  - setuptools
  - wheel
  - requests
  - numpy
  - pip:
    - example_package_Kanav  # Pin the package version, adjust as needed
